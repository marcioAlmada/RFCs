====== PHP RFC: Context Sensitive Lexer ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2015-02-15
  * Author: MÃ¡rcio Almada
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/context_sensitive_lexer

===== Introduction =====

PHP currently has around **64** globally reserved words.
Not infrequently, these reserved words end up clashing with legit alternatives to userland API declarations.
This RFC proposes a partial solution to this growing problem by proposing minimal changes to have a **context sensitive lexer**
with support for **semi-reserved** words.

For instance, if the RFC gets accepted, the following code would now be valid code:

<code php>
class Collection {
    public function list() { /* */ }
}
</code>

Notice that it's now possible to have the ''list'' method delcared without having a syntax error:

<code>
PHP Parse error: Syntax error, unexpected T_LIST, expecting T_STRING on line 2
</code>

===== Proposal =====

This RFC revisits the topic of [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/keywords_as_identifiers|Keywords as Identifiers]] RFC. But this time
presenting a minimal and maintainable [[https://github.com/marcioAlmada/php-src/commit/d9d6f0c7e325dcd0d0ff3c3f2dc73c2364c3ad5f|patch]],
restricted to OO scope only, consistently comprehending:

  * Properties, constants and methods defined on classes, interfaces and traits
  * Access of properties, constants and methods from objects and classes

The proposed changes could be especially useful to:

  - Reduce the surface of BC breaks whenever new keywords are introduced
  - Avoid restricting userland APIs, dispensing the need for hacks like magic method calls or a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesaurus|thesaurus]] to avoid naming conflicts.

This is a list of currently **globally** reserved words that will become **semi-reserved** in case proposed change gets approved:

  callable  class  trait  extends  implements  static  abstract  final  public  protected  private  const
  enddeclare  endfor  endforeach  endif  endwhile  and  global  goto  instanceof  insteadof  interface
  namespace  new  or  xor  try  use  var  exit  list  clone  include  include_once  throw  array
  print  echo  require  require_once  return  else  elseif  default  break  continue  switch  yield
  function  if  endswitch  finally  for  foreach  declare  case  do  while  as  catch  die  self

===== Practical Examples =====

Some practical examples related to the impact this RFC could have on user space code: 

<code php>
// the following example works with the patch
// but currently fails because 'foreach', 'list' and 'new' are reserved words:

class Collection extends \ArrayAccess, \Countable, \IteratorAggregate {

    public function forEach(callable $callback) {
        //...
    }

    public function list() {
        //...
    }

    public static function new(array $itens) {
        return new self($itens);
    }
}

Collection::new(['foo', 'bar'])->forEach(function($index, $item){
  /* callback */
})->list();
</code>

Globally reserved words limit userland implementations on being the most expressive and semantic as possible:

<code php>
// the following example works with the patch, but currently fails because 'extends' is a reserved word:

class View {
    public function include(View $view) {
        //...
    }
}

$viewA = new View('a.view');
$viewA->include(new View('b.view'));
</code>

Sometimes there is simply no better name for a class constant. One might want to define an HTTP agent class and would like to have some HTTP status constants:

<code php>
class HTTP {
    const CONTINUE = 100; // works with patch, but currently fails because 'continue' is a reserved word
    const SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS = 101;
    //...
}
</code>

The proposed change, if approved, also gives more freedom to userland fluent interfaces or DSL like APIs.

<code php>
// following example works with patch
// but currently fails because 'for', 'and', 'or', 'list' are reserved words:

$projects =
    Finder::for('project')
        ->where('name')->like('%secret%')
        ->and('priority', '>', 9)
        ->or('code')->in(['4', '5', '7'])
        ->and()->not('created_at')->between([$time1, $time2])
        ->list($limit, $offset);
</code>

===== Implementation Details =====

The lexer now keeps track of the context needed to have unreserved words on OO scope and makes use of a minimal amount of RE2C lookahead capabilities when disambiguation becomes inevitable.

For instance, the lexing rules to disambiguate ''::class'' (class name resolution operator) from a ''class constant'', ''static variable'' or ''static method'' access is:

<code c++>
<ST_IN_SCRIPTING>"::"/{OPTIONAL_WHITESPACE}"class" {
  return T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM;
}

<ST_IN_SCRIPTING>"::"/{OPTIONAL_WHITESPACE}("$"|{LABEL}){OPTIONAL_WHITESPACE}"("? {
  yy_push_state(ST_LOOKING_FOR_SEMI_RESERVED_NAME);
  return T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM;
}
</code>

Current proposed patch:

  * Keeps ext tokenizer functional
  * Introduces no maintenance issues 

No performance loss was noticed but maybe the patch requires a better benchmark.

=> Many experiments with parsing were done before the current proposed patch which involves only lexing changes. But turns out the patches involving parsing had too many disadvantages.

==== Limitations ====

It's still forbidden to define a class constant named 'class' because of the class name resolution operator ''::class'':

<code php>
class Foo {
  const class = 'Foo'; // throws a fatal error
}

Fatal error: Cannot redefine Foo::class, ::class is reserved in %s on line 2
</code>

===== Impact on performance =====

-- Add benchmark here if asked on discussion phase. --

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

This is proposed for the next PHP x, which at the time of this writing would be PHP 7.

===== Patch =====

  - Most relevant commit is [[https://github.com/marcioAlmada/php-src/commit/d9d6f0c7e325dcd0d0ff3c3f2dc73c2364c3ad5f|d9d6f0]], in case you would like to focus only on the important changes and skip the long tests.
